    <!-- Two Paragraphs About You -->
    <p>Hello! My name is Alivia Richardson, and I am currently a student at Valencia College working toward my AA degree. 
    I enjoy learning about technology, improving my Microsoft Word and keyboarding skills, and building a strong foundation 
    for my future career as an ultrasound technician.</p>

    <p>Outside of school, I love art and design, creating tattoo concepts, and working on personal fitness goals. 
    I also enjoy spending time with my husband, playing Mario Kart, and relaxing together after a busy week.</p>
